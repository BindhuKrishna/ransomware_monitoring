# ransomware_monitoring


This project is a Python-based automation script designed to monitor and process data from a specified API, identify new entries based on a cutoff date, and send alerts via webhooks. The script ensures efficient tracking by maintaining a record of previously processed data, preventing duplicate alerts. Built with **requests**, **json**, and Python's datetime module, it is ideal for use cases involving real-time monitoring of cybersecurity threat feeds, such as ransomware posts. Its modular design allows seamless integration with any webhook-supported alerting system. 

Add your webhook URL, set the cutoff date, and let the script handle the rest!
